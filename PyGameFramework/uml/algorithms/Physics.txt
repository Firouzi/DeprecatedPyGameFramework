Applying Forces:
  BehaviorComponentSystem.update(): Behavior adds forces (movement, jumping, etc)
  PhysicscComponentSystem.update()
    Force Generators Add Forces (gravity, wind, etc)
    Particle.integrate()
      Update positon based on velocity
      Update velocity from acceleration
      (impose drag or other effects)
    contacts = CollisionDetector.detectCollison() - Contacts Generated
    contacts += ContactGenerators.generateContacts - more Contacts Generated
    foreach contact:
        if event
	    #handleEvent
	else
            PhysicsComponentSystem.sendContacts(particle, particle/environment/barrier)
	    ContactResolver.resolveContact(contact)


ContactResolver
1.  applies impulses to particles to simulate bouncing apart (impulse is an insantaneous change in velocity)
2.  resolves interpenetration
3.  (would resolve resting contacts, if needed for the engine - currently not)

For Enviornment:
change accel (add drag) or changes the position (moving surface)
