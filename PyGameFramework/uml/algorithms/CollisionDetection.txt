Note: We don't need to detect if 2 particles that aren't moving collided, so check for both having zero velocity first

Use the course_grained bounding volume, followed by the fine grain volumes.
ob1 vs obj2
(Course vs course)
(Course vs fine)
(fine vs fine)

Only a collision if we have fine vs fine collision
Note that if an entity has no fine volumes, then we can use just the course volume for that entity.
